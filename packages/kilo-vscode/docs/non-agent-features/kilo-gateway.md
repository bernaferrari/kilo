# Kilo Gateway Support

**GitHub Issue:** [#176](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilo/issues/176)
**Priority:** P0
**Status:** ✅ Done (extension scope)

## Description

Support for using the Kilo Gateway — Kilo's cloud-hosted model proxy that provides access to AI models through Kilo's infrastructure.

## Requirements

1. Model used should be the default model for Kilo Gateway
2. Login should be based on whatever user is logged into the CLI at the time (until such time as we support logging in via the extension)
3. Kilo Gateway should appear as a provider option
4. Should work seamlessly with the Kilo authentication flow

## Current State

Auth flow works ([`DeviceAuthCard.tsx`](../../webview-ui/src/components/DeviceAuthCard.tsx)), profile/balance display exists ([`ProfileView.tsx`](../../webview-ui/src/components/ProfileView.tsx)). The CLI backend handles Kilo Gateway connections.

`ProvidersTab` now includes explicit startup model controls for new sessions:

- Startup model selector (`kilo-code.new.model.providerID` + `kilo-code.new.model.modelID`)
- One-click "Use Kilo Gateway Default" action backed by the CLI provider defaults map
- Optional `Prefer Kilo Gateway Default` toggle (`kilo-code.new.model.preferGatewayDefault`) so new sessions automatically follow the gateway default model when available

## Notes

- CLI-side gateway/auth behavior remains owned by the backend; extension-side model and auth UX wiring is complete.
- Related to [Provider Configuration](provider-configuration.md) and [Model Switcher](model-switcher.md).
