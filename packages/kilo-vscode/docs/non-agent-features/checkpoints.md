# Checkpoints (shadow versioning, workspace time travel)

- **What it is**: Task-scoped snapshots stored in a shadow git repository, with UI to diff/restore.

## Capabilities

- Per-task checkpoint history.
- Restore files only vs restore files + task state.
- Safety checks to avoid problematic paths/nested repos.

## Docs references

- [`apps/kilocode-docs/pages/code-with-ai/features/checkpoints.md`](../../apps/kilocode-docs/pages/code-with-ai/features/checkpoints.md)

## Suggested migration

- **Kilo CLI availability**: Partial.
- **Migration recommendation**:
  - Evaluate whether Kilo CLI snapshots/revert semantics map to Kilo checkpoints (per-task, excludes, UX expectations).
  - If they map, delegate snapshot creation/storage/revert to Kilo CLI; otherwise keep the existing Kilo checkpoint service.
- **Reimplementation required?**: Partial.

## Current progress

- Session-level undo/revert/fork flows are wired through the chat UI and CLI endpoints.
- "See New Changes" integration provides quick git-change review after checkpoint-like operations.
- Added dedicated checkpoint restore picker flow (Task Header `Checkpoints`): native quick-pick session timeline + explicit restore confirmation dialog.
- Remaining parity work is the dedicated shadow-repo checkpoint system (snapshot history, selective restore, safety checks).

## Primary implementation anchors

- [`src/services/checkpoints/`](../../src/services/checkpoints/)
