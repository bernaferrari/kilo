# Special Content Types

Interactive elements for specialized message content beyond plain markdown/code.

## Status

✅ Done

## Location

Content type rendering is now handled by kilo-ui's `<KiloMessage>` component which includes renderers for reasoning blocks, tool results, and other part types. The old standalone components (`ReasoningBlock`, `OpenMarkdownPreviewButton`, etc.) don't exist in the new extension.

## Interactions

- **OpenMarkdownPreviewButton**: Opens markdown in VS Code preview
- **ReasoningBlock**: Collapsible AI reasoning display
- **MCP Tool/Resource Rows**: Interactive MCP server tool execution
- **Error Rows**: Expandable error details with copy functionality

## Current Progress

- Open-markdown-preview action is available from assistant message actions/context menu
- Reasoning parts render via kilo-ui reasoning renderer
- Tool error rows now support detail expansion and copy-to-clipboard actions
- DataProvider bridge now wires question/task callbacks (reply/reject, session navigation/sync) for richer interactive message-part behavior
- Tool/resource rows now include broader inline link/resource affordances (`Open Link` / `Copy Link`) from tool metadata/output extraction, including MCP/web-oriented wrappers where available.

## Remaining Gaps

- None for migration-plan parity scope.

## Suggested migration

**Reimplement?** Completed (mixed UI/adapter ownership).

- UI components like collapsible reasoning and expandable errors can remain in the webview.
- MCP tool/resource interactions should be revalidated:
  - If the extension remains the MCP host, keep current behavior.
  - If MCP moves to Kilo CLI (`GET /mcp` / `POST /mcp` are referenced in [`docs/opencode-core/opencode-migration-plan.md`](docs/opencode-core/opencode-migration-plan.md:1)), you’ll need adapter work to map Kilo CLI MCP events/results into the existing Kilo MCP rows.
- “Open markdown preview in VS Code” is inherently a VS Code integration; keep it in the extension/webview.
